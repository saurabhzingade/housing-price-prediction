# housing-price-prediction

This is a basic dataset that can be used to predict the price of the housing.

Not a great prediction due to some outliers . It can sometimes vary to a limit of 90 to 100k but the regression from the neural netwroks is still amazing! 
 Implemeted it while learning tensorflow 2.0 and its features.
